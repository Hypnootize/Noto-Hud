<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud

**2)** Copy the noto hud folder (**NOT** noto-hud-Master, the one inside it!)

**3)** Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\noto hud)

**4)** Go to Resource/Fonts select all the font and install them (rightclick while selected and install)

**NOTES:**

I suggest using **"tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health" "1"** since the floating version is not as consistan and can have problems.

The original rgb code for the damage numbers is: hud_combattext_red 255; hud_combattext_green 255; hud_combattext_blue 0
